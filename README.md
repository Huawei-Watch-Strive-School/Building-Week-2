<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Run for your life is a startup tech company. Our goal is to develop a fitness software that is able to be used plug and play style into most apps and smart watches, in a Google Fit style.
One of the main ideas behind the project is to facilitate the calorie counting and make it more precise. In order to do this you will need to build a model that use the different measurements of your phone to classify the activity the athletes are taking part on accurately.
Even though the initial focus is to get it working in as smartphone for Google Fit. We would like for it to work also in less powerful devices like smart watches.

Since the software is meant to complement other apps the easier it is to attach to a fitness software the easier it would be to sell. Same applies to devices, the more devices is works on the easier it will be to sell.


### Missions
We are looking for a model with incredible accuracy in as many classes as possible. We are willing to sacrifice some accuracy in exchange for classifying more classes, but never too much.
The model should be adaptable to more devices that maybe don't measure as much data as the one in our dataset so if you are able to achieve great results with less data we would be very interested in taking a look at them.
The more lightweight the better we even accept a ‘lite’ submission for smartwatches with the main submission.
What if we didn't need to plug this into another software? If you are able to do a precise calorie counter and deliver it with the model please do.



### Data Description

The dataset is based on the 13 users who collected the data during their daily activities. The dataset includes all sensors available in phones and distinguishes five transportation modes: 
/ being on a car
/ on a bus
/ on a train
/ standing still
/ walking.
