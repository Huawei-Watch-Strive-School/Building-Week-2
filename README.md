<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Our collaborator team works on these tasks and challenges that need to be achieved to achieve the goals of project Baby Yoda as a part of AI Engineer batch at Strive School.
- We think there are 3 different galaxies in our cluster of data find them and map them.
- Generate a map only of the uppermost galaxy
- we think BeBe Yoda is in the rightmost planet of this galaxy. Plot the highlighted planet on the original data
- Input the coordinates into the force finder
- From the planet data you will need to extract the force concentration and its two principal components. Map them.
- Find BeBe Yoda in the closest point to the gravitational center of the two principal components of the force. Highlight in a map the gravitational center and the closest point.
- Deliver the force coordinates to high command. 

### Data Description

The dataset is based on the 13 users who collected the data during their daily activities. The dataset includes all sensors available in phones and distinguishes five transportation modes: 
/ being on a car
/ on a bus
/ on a train
/ standing still
/ walking.
